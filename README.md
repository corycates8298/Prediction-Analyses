## Introduction

In this analysis, we explore historical sales data and develop a predictive model to forecast future item sales. The goal is to provide insights for store owners or managers to optimize operations, inventory management, and decision-making processes.

## Installation

To run the notebook and replicate the analysis, please follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/corycates8298/Prediction-Analyses.git`
   

## Usage

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`
2. Open the "Item Sales Prediction Analysis July 2023.ipynb" notebook.
3. Run each cell sequentially to reproduce the analysis and predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is not included in this repository due to its size. However, you can find the dataset from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1syH81TVrbBsdymLT_jl2JIf6IjPXtSQw/view?usp=sharing and place it in the same directory as the notebook.

## Notebook

The notebook, "Item Sales Prediction Analysis July 2023.ipynb," contains the complete analysis pipeline, including data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and prediction generation. It also includes detailed explanations and code comments to guide you through the process.

## Results

The results of this analysis include the predicted item sales, evaluation metrics, and insights derived from the trained model. The notebook provides visualizations and interpretations to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the sales trends and patterns.
